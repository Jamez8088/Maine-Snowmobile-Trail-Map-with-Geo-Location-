# Maine Snowmobile Trail Map with Geo-Location
Using the map layer publically available on Arcgis.com, then places a simple GPS locator icon on the map showing where you are with the majority of snowmobile trails in Maine, easy as that. 
I do not own the rights to any of these map layers, all map layers are from ArcGIS which can be found here:
